### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Testing is key to this end. Just about every program will have functionality errors, security vulnerabilities, and bugs. The way we work these out is via intense testing of the program.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpretting user needs is done by asking a lot of questions to the end users or client who will be using/ owning the application. Only when we have a firm grip on the requirements of the program can we even begin to incorporate them into code.

### How do I approach designing software?
My approach is to first understand the requirements of the software, scetch up some visual diagrams, and then finally work on the actual code itself. This code will be structured in such a way that it is modularized, easy to understand, and easy to maintain post launch.
